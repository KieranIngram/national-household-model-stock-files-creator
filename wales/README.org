* Stock creation for Wales
This works by reweighting an English stock

Run [[file:main.R][main.R]] to produce the stock.

Run [[file:histograms.R][histograms.R]] to produce a comparison of how well it works.

Modify [[file:constants.R][constants.R]] to change where the inputs come from and where the outputs go.

** Inputs
 1. An English stock, which we will reweight.
 2. A table of desired weights for combinations of Welsh variables. The columns to the left of the table will be matched perfectly, the latter columns will get progressively worse.
