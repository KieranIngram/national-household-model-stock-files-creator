# Accessing Housing Stock Data
The NHM stock conversion programmes use housing condition surveys from England, Wales and Scotland. The most recently available versions of the surveys are:

* English Housing Survey 2013 (EHS 2013)
* Living in Wales Survey 2008 (LiW 2008)
* Scottish Housing Condition Survey 2007-09 (SHCS 2011-13)

In order to access the England and Wales housing stock data, you will need to register for an account with the UK Data Archive and access the housing stock databases through the UK Data Service website.
